    <p>My hope is to find a steady job in programming that both interests and challenges me. I am not driven by a desire to work for any specific company, but rather am still focusing on the kind of programs I would like to design. I have considered working on websites, games, and apps, and think that any one of them could be rewarding, though at this point, I do not have enough experiences with programming to know exactly which I would be most interested by.</p>
	
	<p>In my courses I have worked in both C++ and Java, and I have enjoyed the projects I did in both. I have also done a small amount of work with Ruby in the past, and have worked on a few websites using HTML, although that was several years ago and my knowledge has waned since then. I am planning to learn coding in many other languages as well. Hopefully finding out what sort of projects I most enjoy working on will help me find out what programming languages would be most beneficial for me to know when seeking employment in the future.</p>
