    <p>My parents currently live in Cocoa, FL, a mere two and half hours away from Gainesville. My father works as a mechanical engineer at the Florida Solar Energy Center, where he looks into ways to help homeowners save power. My mother is a speech therapist who is currently unemployed but works as a Girl Scout leader for two troops and has been the Cookie Chair for the Sparkling Rivers area in the past. I also have two younger sisters, Erica and Jackie, who are in ninth and seventh grade respectively. My older sister lives in Texas, and we visit her on occasion.</p>
	
	<p>We also keep two dogs as pets named Skip and Zuzu. They are a mix between cocker spaniels and poodles. </p>

    <p>I have played the trumpet since fourth grade, and was a member of the UF Marching Band for my first two years at the university. I have also played in concert band and in the basketball pep band, which I look forward to joining again in October. Instrumental music has always been a passion of mine. I am a casual player; I put in practice hours as they are required but do not put in the kind of work necessary to be an expert with the instrument. Playing the trumpet helps me to deal with the stress of college life because it is fun and rewarding without being a challenge.</p>
	
	<p>My other hobbies include reading, writing stories, and biking. Writing especially is another activity that helps me to unwind and keep from stressing too much about my classes and projects. I do not consider myself an expert writer by any means but am always working on improving my skills, even though it is just for my own personal interest.</p>
